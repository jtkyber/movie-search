## Movie Search
As the name suggests, Movie Search is a web application that allows the user to search for movies, tv shows, and even games. After a title is submitted, all of the results that match the entry will appear below with the following information available:
* Poster
* Title
* Type (movie, series, game, etc.)
* Production year/range

Theses results can be toggled between a list view and a card view via the icon in the upper right hand corner of the page. Upon selection of a result (by clicking on it's container), a modal will appear in the center of the screen, displaying the following content related to the selection:
* Title
* Type (movie, series, game, etc.)
* Production year/range
* Plot
* Actors
* Genre
* Director(s)
* Writer(s)
* Production
* Awards
* Box office
* Language(s)
* Rating (PG-13, G, T, etc.)
* IMDB rating

At the bottom of the modal, there is an option to add the selected result to the user's favorites list. When clicked, the movie will be visible in the favorites list, which can be accessed via the "favorites" button located left of the toggle icon. If a result is selected that is already in the user's favorites list, a "remove from favorites" button will be available in the modal, both on the search page and on the favorites page. When in the favorites page, a red "X" will be visible on each result, allowing the user to quickly remove it from the list.
